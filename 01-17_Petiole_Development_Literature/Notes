############### General Information ############################

Lateral outgrowth of the blade requires the juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial identities
	Mutations that impair adaxial leaf fate can result in patches of abaxial tissue misplaced on the adaxial side, capable of forming new boundaries

Arabidopsis petioles express a number of lateral organ boundary markers (BOP1/2, AS2, KNAT6)
	suggesting that petioles are an extension of the boundary where growth is restricted





############### BOP Genes in Leaf Architecture #################

A transcription factor that does not have a DNA-binding domain; require the help of TGA1 and TGA4 for DNA binding

Expression:
BOP1 and BOP2 are expressed at the base of developing Arabidopsis rosette leaves and are largely redundant

Mutant:
In Arabidopsis bop1;bop2 double mutants:
	1. KNOX genes are re-activated after leaf initiation, just like in compound leaves
	2. Growth process:
		proximal-distal growth of the petiole is prolonged causing elongated leaf form
		petiole abaxialized to create a rachis-like structure
		petiole initiates continuous blade (boundary genes not expressed) or leaflets (boundary genes expressed)
	3. Analysis of cell division markers shows a shift of proliferative activity from the blade-petiole junction in WT to the leaf base in bop1;bop2
	3. Stipules are absent

Downstream:
BOP1/2 activates KNOX suppressors such as AS1 and AS2, in the proximal region of the developing leaf primordia
Serves as a lateral organ boundary gene, and promotes the expression of other boundary genes including AS2, KNAT6, ATH1

Upstream: 
BOP1/2 is inactivated by KNOX genes in developing embryonic shoot apical meristem
	Nuclear-cytoplasm localization is a possible mechanism, probably subject to the redox status of the cell
In rice (BOP_in_rice.pdf), miR156 promotes juvenille trait, and miR156 up-regulates BOP by targeting its inhibitor SPL






############### CLE5 and CLE6 ###################################

Expression:
Expressed at the base of leaf primordia, adjacent to the meristem

Upstream:
Positively regulated by BOP1/2, but is not directly
Negatively regulated by AS2 (forming an incoherent feedforward loop)
Positively regulated by WOX1 and PRS

Mutant:
cle5;cle6 double mutant shows no obvious leaf phenotype




############### AS1 and AS2 ####################################

Upstream:
AS1 is negatively regulated by STM in SAM
BOP1 directly binds to AS2 promoter to induce its expression

Expression:
1. In Jun 2010 paper Fig 3D, activation of BOP1 is able to activate AS2 promoter from the proximal to the distal region of the leaf
2. Without BOP1, AS2 is only expressed at the very base of the leaf (Fig 3D 1st column; also compare Fig 4 C1 C2 and H1)

Downstream:
Forms a complex to represse KNOX activity

Mutant:
as1:
	Shorter petiole in earlier leaves
	Lobes in later leaves
	Ectopic outgrowth of callus-like tissue





############### JAG: Positive Regulator of Blade Outgrowth #####

Gain-of-function mutants produce leafy petioles

In WT, JAG expression is restricted to the blade
In BOP1/2 mutants, JAG expression expands to the petiole

Upstream:
JAG and NUB are repressed by BOP1/BOP2 in the proximal leaf domain, and thus they are only active in the distal region
