I hypothesize that, in the situation where:
	There is growth inhibitor 2 action (being produced where GF concentration is low)
	The growth is terminated by the height gain less than a threshold
	In this case, the GF and the GI interacts so that when GI concentration exceeds a threshold growth stops (no matter what concentration GF is)
The mature size of the sepal should be
	robust w.r.t. response curve of the tissue to the growth factor
	un-robust w.r.t. production of the growth factor

To test this, in this folder:
	J is changed from 0.03 to
	0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10

Results: not robust
