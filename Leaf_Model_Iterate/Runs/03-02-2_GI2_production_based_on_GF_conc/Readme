This run is an attempt to adjust the production of the growth inhibitor (at the tip) in response to the growth factor concentration.

Ideally:
The growth inhibitor is not produced or produced at very low concentration at the beginning
Produced at high concentration in the end
Concentration should be high even at the base, in the end
(There is no quantified criteria of selection)

The range of parameters tried:
DInh: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4
GI2transitionalGFconc: 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, 0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003, 0.00001

Based on the simulation, the best parameter set is:
DInh: 0.4
GI2transitionalGFconc: 0.00001
Note that this is not optimized (just "it might work")
