I hypothesize that, in the situation where:
	There is growth inhibitor 2 action (being produced where GF concentration is low)
	The growth is terminated by the height gain less than a threshold
The mature size of the sepal should be
	robust w.r.t. response curve of the tissue to the growth factor
	un-robust w.r.t. production of the growth factor

To test this, in this folder:
	Rhz is changed from 0.03 to
	0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05
