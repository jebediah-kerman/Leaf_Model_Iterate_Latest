---------Sepals------------

General shape in WT:

Growth rate, anisotropy, and cell proliferation in WT:
Curr Biol 2016 Hervieux Fig1

ROS accumulation pattern in WT:
Hong_et_al_Fig6D, note that arrest front starts approximately when the sepal size is (slightly less than) half of mature size

Shape affected by ROS:
Hong_et_al_Fig6J, central two (in CAT OE, arrest front starts late, see Hong_et_al_FigS6G), right (constitutive ROS)

Elasticity affected by ROS:
Hong_et_al_Fig6M
	in ftsh4-5 compared with WT, on average, cells are 67% stiffer (shrinkage 11% vs 17%, expansion 12% vs 20%)
	So maybe ROS increases elasticity by 60%



---------Leaves-----------
